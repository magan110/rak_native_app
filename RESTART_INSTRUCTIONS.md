# Steps to See the New Drawer Menu

## The drawer has been successfully updated! To see the changes:

### Option 1: Hot Restart (Fastest)
1. In the terminal where `flutter run` is active, press **`R`** (capital R)
2. This will perform a full hot restart

### Option 2: Stop and Restart
1. In the terminal where `flutter run` is active, press **`q`** to quit
2. Run `flutter run` again

### Option 3: Complete Clean Build (if above don't work)
1. Close any running Flutter apps
2. Run: `flutter clean`
3. Run: `flutter pub get`
4. Run: `flutter run`

## What's Changed:

✅ **User Info**: Now shows actual logged-in user name and area (from AuthManager)
✅ **Dynamic Menu**: Different menu items for Painters/Contractors vs. other users
✅ **Navigation**: All menu items now navigate to proper routes using go_router
✅ **Logout**: Properly calls AuthService.logout() and redirects to login

## Troubleshooting:

If you still see the old drawer after hot restart:
- Make sure you pressed **`R`** (capital R) not **`r`** (lowercase - that's hot reload)
- Try stopping the app completely (`q`) and running again
- Check that the file saved properly (no compile errors shown)
